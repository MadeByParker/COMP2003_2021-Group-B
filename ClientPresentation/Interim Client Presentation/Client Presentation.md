## List of project objectives.

### Design:

We are continuously enhancing our design based on the client's constructive feedback. As we develop the website, we are:
* improving the flow of the website so users have no problem with navigating
* testing that the design is accessible to all users is a big factor, such as ensuring text readabilty for users who are visually impaired
* and also ensuring that the website has cross-device functionality, so it functions properly on phone's as well as computers.
	
### Membership: 

Gaining membership is a crucial part of the South Hams Society website, so we have been working on developing a new membership form to replace the current pdf form.

This new memebership form is aimed to be:
* Convenient - The user isn't required to scan or print off the form, they only need to enter the details on the website.
* Easy to understand - Each input box will have a clear visual label indicating what the user needs to enter.
* Accessible - Clear and readable text, keyboard navigation, error messages.

### Administration: 
Ensuring that the website is managable by you is a crucial objective. 
* We have been working on the implementation of Drupal as requested by the client to allow the administrators of South Hams Society to manage content and maintain the website.
* We are aware that members of the South Hams Society will have different permissions, so we will be implementing permissions to:
* prevent non-admin users from accessing/editing certain content on the website
* add two different admin permissions, one admin role will have the ability to control the whole website, and the other will only be able to post.

## Side Objectives:

### Security:

As today’s society moves more towards web technology and the internet, we are all for to make the website secure and safe for its user

* IP/Email Address Spam Proofing
* Secure Database for the logins
* DDoS Prevention

As shown below (Subject to change)

## Risk management plan. ##

For the risk management plan, a RAID log will be used. The RAID log consists of a table that outlines the Risks, Assumptions, Issues and Dependencies. 

* Risks are specific incidents that could occur during development and would have a negative impact on the project. They may not have occurred yet, but would have a detrimental impact. The assumptions are things we assume are in place and contribute to the project’s success, and can be either positive or negative. Issues are risks that have already occurred that need to be considered and addressed. Finally, the dependencies exist when we need to keep track of certain frameworks/libraries used to develop the application.

* Over the course of development, bi-weekly updates will be made to the RAID log to ensure that development obstacles are maintained. 

* The log is made parallel with the sprint plan to ensure that the actions are completed on time.

* Priorities are categorised from high to low as: Critical, High, Moderate, Low, and Non-Essential.

| RAID Category | Type  | Description | Impact | Priority | Status | Action
|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:| :--:|
| Risk | Technical | Injection | Unauthorised view of data | Moderate | Open | Use parameterized queries |
| Issue | Technical | Membership form not submitting | User cannot apply for membership | Critical | Open | Troubleshoot |
| Risk | Technical | Weak passwords being used | Higher risk of passwords being bruteforced | Critical | Open | Require strong passwords |
