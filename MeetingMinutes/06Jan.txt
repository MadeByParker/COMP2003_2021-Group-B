Absent:

* Oliver - authorised due to WiFi Issues - but later caught up with what was discussed

Meeting events:

* Made important decision of what libraries are going to be used.

In the end, we decided on using Bootstrap 4.0 for the Custom HTML/CSS Library, later found Font-Awesome Icons could be
used for copyright symbol, etc...

* Made decisions allocating which pages each team member was going to design and implement into the prototype.

This ensures that we use the time efficiently and there's no duplication of work being carried out therefore loss of time.

* Discussed the risk management and communication plans.

* Thomas was in charge of the going through the risk management plan.
* Harry initially set up responbilities for each team member to ensure efficent time usage before we collectively agreed on the roles for the new sprint.
* Oliver, after the last meeting, had a boilerplate template for when we move our Website onto Drupal.
* James was in charge of the communication plan.
