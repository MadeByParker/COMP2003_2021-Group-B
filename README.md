### Product Vision:

This Project was carried out to create a rebranded cross-platform website for the South Hams Society that will make a difference and inspire locals to save the environment around them and preserve it for the future generations. The aim of this project is to make Society Memberships easier for the Society's Commitees and regular members and to bring frequent updated news to the website where society members can be up to date to what is going on in the South Hams and can also use this website to gain knowledge on how they can help in protecting the South Hams' landscape, economy and people.

### List of project objectives: 

#### Main objectives:
* Design
* We are continuously enhancing our design based on the client's constructive feedback

#### Requests / feedback on their current website:

* Improving the flow of the website so users have no problem with navigating
* Testing that the design is accessible to all users is a big factor, such as: 
* Ensuring text readability for users who are visually impaired
* Ensuring that the website has cross-device functionality, so it functions properly on phones as well as computers.
* Having a convenient membership form as well as an option for the user to download a paper copy

#### Membership:

* Gaining membership is a crucial part of the South Hams Society website, so we have been working on developing a new membership form to replace the current pdf form.

#### This new membership form is aimed to be:

* Convenient - The user isn't required to scan or print the form, they only need to enter the details on the website.
* Easy to understand - Each input box will have a clear visual label indicating what the user needs to enter.
* Accessible - Clear and readable text, keyboard navigation, error messages.

#### Administration - how the website is going to be managed by the client after development and deployment:

* Assuring that the website is manageable by you is a crucial objective. 
* We have been working on the implementation of Textpattern as requested by the client to allow the administrators of South Hams Society to manage content and maintain the website.
* We are aware that members of the South Hams Society will have different permissions, so we will be implementing permissions to:
prevent non-admin users from accessing/editing certain content on the website
* Add two different admin permissions, one admin role will have the ability to control the whole website, and the other will only be able to post.
